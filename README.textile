h2. Robotlegs For Corona: A pure AS3 micro-architecture originally for Flash and Flex, ported to Corona

Robotlegs For Corona is a lightweight Lua MVCS micro-architecture. Robotlegs was created to provide a small, loosely coupled application framework that is easy to test.

Robotlegs enables:

* Dependency Injection (sort of, not really... haven't figured out metadata/annotations in Lua yet)
* Loosely coupled inter-object messaging using native Corona Events
* Simple command execution and automation
* View component mediation
