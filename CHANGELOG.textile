h2. Robotlegs Framework Changelog:

h3. v0.3

October 1st, 2011

Re-worked how mapping works. You must:
- have a classType variable on your class instance. For now, it points to your class name.

If you have a class:

com.your.Class

Then your classType should be:

obj.classType = "Class"

- you must pass in the entire package path to your class. Sadly, we have no way to use this currently
as Corona doesn't seem to retain package information.

self:mapMediator("com.your.Class", "com.your.ClassMediator")
